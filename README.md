# metacity-backend

This project was created using ASP.NET Core 9.0. It is used as a backend for the Metacity Device Map.

## Development server

Run `dotnet run` to host the backend. Navigate to `http://localhost:5120/swagger/` to see more documentation about the backend. To call the Devices endpoint, post a GET request to `http://localhost:5120/Devices/`.

To use the map that this backend serves, go to the repository of the [frontend](https://github.com/aif-software/metacity-sensor-map) and follow the directions there.
